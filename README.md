# NBA-Player-Progression-Tracker
This program tracks NBA player progression before and after COVID-19 quarantine. Python packages BeautifulSoup and Selenium are utilized to web scrape player statistics from basketballreference.com and nba.com/stats. Then, the data is stored in a MySQL database containing three tables: BeforeQ, AfterQ, and Player. Once the data is properly stored, an interactive user interface is created in Tableau. The user can either track an individual player or specific stat category. In the latter, the top 10 and bottom 10 most improved players will be listed.
